      1. Overview
    </h2>
    <p class="content-item">
      DramaQA challenge is a large-scale video QA task based on a Korean popular TV show, “Another Miss Oh”. Given a video clip and a natural language question about the clip, the task is to choose an accurate natural language answer. The questions selectively target different level of difficulties, namely, the level of understanding. 
      <br />
      Also, multi-level character-centered story descriptions are provided. We are expecting this challenge could be a starting point to evaluate human-level video story understanding.
      <br /><br />
      The DramaQA train, validation, and test sets are available on the <a id="link" href="/Download ">download</a> page. Answers on the training and validation sets are publicly available but answers for test sets are not provided to challenge participants.
